# You-Got-This

The three main Prompts outputs are displayed in the format "<First_Name>_<Last_Name>_<Prompt number>.png "
  
The solution code is under "UCSF Coding challenge" title


In the third prompt, I applied a contrast enhancement filter to improve the visual appearance of a pixelated image. I used histogram equalization by redistributing the pixel intensities.

However, in a situation with better image resolution, four matrix filters (two for horizontal edges and two for vertical edges) would be more beneficial. That is when those filters are applied in the convolution layers in the CNN (convolutional neural networks). I'm utilizing them in the research statement while analyzing the MRI images of the AD patients' brains.
